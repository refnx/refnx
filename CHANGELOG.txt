Details of changes made to refnx
================================

0.1.1
-----
- removal of Python 2.7 support
- added azure pipelines for faster windows CI
- remove `uncertainties` as a package dependency (it's still used for testing)
- remove `six` as a package dependency
- add `refnx.util.refplot` for quick plotting of reflectometry datasets
- fixed various deprecation warnings
- added the ability to mask (hide) points in a `refnx.dataset.Data1D` dataset

0.1.2
-----
- added save/load model buttons in the interactive reflectometry modeller.
- removed `from __future__ import ...` statements as refnx is now solely Py3
- added `cython: language_level=3` statements to cython code
- marked cython extensions as c++ language
- smarter (faster) cataloging of NeXUS files
- removed pandas as a strict dependency, as it's only required for reduction,
  not analysis
- improved documentation of the ManualBeamFinder
- adding a pyqt based GUI (alpha state)
- improved __repr__ of many classes
- Start the GUI via a 'refnx' console command, via a setup.py entry_point.

0.1.3
-----
- GUI machinery can now use Components other than Slab, such as LipidLeaflet
  (already added). New Components may require extra shim code to be written for
  them. Specifically how they're to be displayed, and a default way of
  initialising the Component (which may require a dialogue).
- The 'Link equivalent parameters' action has been added, enabling equivalent
  parameters on other datasets to be linked. This greatly aids setup of multiple
  contrast datasets. All the datasets to be linked must have the same type of
  structure.
- The initialisation of a LipidLeaflet is made much easier by using a library
  of lipid head/volumes and scattering lengths for popular lipids which are
  presented to the user in an initialisation dialogue.
- The refnx paper is accepted and the article and manuscript file are
  included in the repository.
- The pyqt GUI to refnx can be made into standalone executables for Windows,
  macOS.
- Fixed a bug that meant most reflectivity calculations were single-threaded
  instead of multi-threaded.
- Added MixedReflectModel to the pyqt GUI, allowing one to model 'patchy'
  systems, i.e. incoherent averaging of reflectivities.
- BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: the slabs properties of `Component` and
  `Structure` have now been changed to methods, taking the optional `structure`
  kwd parameter. The reason for this is so each `Component` knows what kind of
  `Structure` it is in.
- The Spline Component can be used within the pyqt GUI.
- In the pyqt gui Components can be re-ordered within their host structure by
  drag/drop. Dragging to other Structures copies the Component to that
  structure.
- Added the Stack Component. A Stack contains a series of Components, and the
  Stack.repeats attribute can be used to produce a multilayer repeat structure.
- Folded in a reduction pyqt gui for Platypus data. The app was already in the
  slim directory. It's now available from refnx.reduce.gui

0.1.4
-----
- fixed bug in reflectivity calculation with significant non-zero absorption.
  The wavevector calculation was using the wrong branch of the complex sqrt.

0.1.5
-----
- fixed font size in pyqt GUI.
- script export from pyqt GUI can use either multiprocessing or MPI for
  parallelisation during MCMC sampling.
- speeded up reflectivity calculation, following on from changes made in 0.1.4
  (if the imaginary part of a complex sqrt argument is very small, then the C++
  calculation takes a lot longer).
- added a plot method to PlatypusNexus
- refactor util.PoolWrapper to util.MapWrapper
- allow the number of Stack repeats to be fittable.
- GUI option to only display those parameters (and datasets) that are going to
  be varied in a fit.
- update testimonials.bib
- "to code" button in Jupyter interactive modeller respects the transform
  popup.

0.1.6
-----
- When parameters are linked in the refnx GUI only the dataset containing the
  master parameter was being updated (reflectivity/SLD curves) when the master
  was changed. Now all datasets that have parameters linked to the master
  parameter (a constraint) are updated.
- When a dataset/component/structure containing a master parameter (i.e. a
  parameter to which other parameters are constrained to) is removed, the GUI
  now unlinks those dependent parameters from the master parameter.
- display number of iterations in GUI progress box. If fit is aborted put best
  fit so far into Objective that's being fitted.
- fixed crash resulting from the use of a comma when entering a floating point
  number. Entering '3,1' would crash the gui, using '3.1' would work but be
  displayed as '3,1'. The use of a dot as a decimal point is now enforced.

0.1.7
-----
- print human readable output when fitting with the Jupyter interactive
  modeller.
- added shgo and dual_annealing minimiser options to the refnx gui.
- SLD calculator retains state between viewings.
- Added dialogue to adjust optimisation parameters.
- Fixed bug in export of MCMC code fragment, Gui would crash.
- Autocorrelation plot produced from mcmc.py code fragment, this can be used to
  judge how much to thin the chains by.
- `refnx.analysis` now possesses a standalone function, `autocorrelation_chain`
  for calculating chain autocorrelation. Previously the calculation had to be
  done using a CurveFitter instance.
- Function for calculating autocorrelation time made visible as:
  `refnx.analysis.integrated_time`. You should pass the autocorrelation array
  to this function.
- GUI can now export an ASCII file representing the model SLD curve.
- BUG: when the GUI saves a model it should pickle a ReflectModel. It wasn't
  doing this, it was pickling a DataObject. This has now been fixed, but the
  fix affects back compatibility.
- *GUI can now do MCMC sampling*
- Add option to change context of Mapwrapper (spawn/fork/forkserver)
- BUG: when loading (not refreshing) a dataset that was already loaded, the
  associated model was lost. (GH331)
- Added a progress bar for batch fitting.
- Speeded up batch fitting

0.1.8
-----
- When GUI experiment file is loaded the correct fitting algorithm wasn't being
  set correctly (GH338).
- Prevent crash when trying to refresh a stale dataset (i.e. is no longer in
  its original location.
- Produce autocorrelation graph when sampling in GUI.
- Added links to ptemcee and emcee in the optimisation parameters window.
- GUI produces corner plot after MCMC sampling
- BUG fix for rebinning code (doesn't affect analysis)
- Different interfacial roughness types can be specified between all Components
  in a Structure. The available types are: Erf (Error Function, default), Tanh,
  Sinusoidal, Exponential, Step, Linear. User specifiable interfaces can be
  created by subclassing Interface.
- A fix for the PyQt5 interface using 4K screens on Windows was made.
  Previously the GUI elements and fonts were being displayed in a much too
  small fashion.
- Made various dialogues in the PyQt5 GUI window modal (to prevent them being
 lost).
- fixed bugs if cancel was pressed during the MCMC folder dialogue phase.
- made loading of experiment file back compatible.

0.1.9
-----
- Added DOTAP, h-DOPC, 18:1 Diether PC to lipids database
- Updated SLIM reduction software to cope with the new monobloc detector
- Improve speed of resolution smearing by using splev/splrep
- Added shell scripts to build manylinux and macOS wheels (as well as test
 them).
- Some minor optimisations for calculation of `Interval.logp`.
- Some minor optimisations for various calculations in `Objective`.
- Fixed potential for crashes in ManualBeamFinder if controls specified
  regions that went outside the detector region.
- cythonized contract_by_area, resulting in huge speedup for microsliced
  structures.
- Enabled parallel calculation of reflectivity using OpenMP. Tests show that
  it should be ~20% faster than the previous calculation in C.
- tqdm progress bar for ptemcee sampling (if tqdm is installed).
- Cleaned up the _creflect module. Threaded reflectivity calculation in that
  extension now uses std::thread instead of pthreads (POSIX) or WinAPI
  (windows).

0.1.10
------
- Prevent spurious benchmark package installation.
- Fixed bug when loading a MTFT file saved in a previous version of refnx.
- event mode data reduction sped up by an order of magnitude
- Added neutron transmission calculator (if periodictable is present)
- event file reader can now read any ANSTO packedbin file (reduction).
- Align SLD plots around a specific interface in a slab representation. Useful
  if plotting many samples at the same time.
- Add MaterialSLD object that is constructed from a chemical formula and mass
  density. This enables the use of specific materials to describe layers, e.g.
  MaterialSLD('SiO2', density=2.2).
- Components can be multiplied by an integer to make them repeat.
- Add _open_mp_helpers to MANIFEST.in (gh381).
- update bundled vendored emcee

0.1.11
------
- Fixed a bug in the GUI that prevented load/save of mixed area models.
- Fixed a bug in the resynthesis of data.
- Fixed a bug in the loading of event data from the Platypus monobloc detector.
- Added a FresnelTransform.
- Document inequality constraints.
- Made refnx SLD calculator GUI more fault tolerant to incorrect formula.
- Add example Jupyter notebook for batch reduction.
- Autoscaling for Panalytical XRR reduction.
- Fixed bug in drag/drop within a Stack in the GUI.
- Added a MixedSlab Component which is constituted from several individual
  Scatterers. The SLD of the MixedSlab is weighted by their volume fractions.

0.1.12
------
- allow master and slave chopper parameters to be ignored in PLP reduction.
- tunable t_0 offset in PLP/SPZ reduction.
- possibly_create_parameter accepts default bounds/vary/constraint. This fixes
  a bug in MixedSlab.
- Don't require numpy be installed before setup.py can run.
- Speed up reflectivity calculation if there is solvation.
- reflect.choose_dq_type for finding out fastest mode of resolution smearing.
- User can now select resolution smearing approach in ReflectModel. Choosing
  between 'pointwise' or 'constant'.
- Add progress bar for Curvefitter.fit() (requires tqdm being installed).
- A few micro-optimisations.
- Optimized pickling/unpickling of Bounds instances. This can lead to a huge
  performance increase (~ 40%) when doing parallel sampling.
- MCMC sampling initialisation made reproducible
