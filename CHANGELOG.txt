Details of changes made to refnx
================================

0.1.1
-----
- removal of Python 2.7 support
- added azure pipelines for faster windows CI
- remove `uncertainties` as a package dependency (it's still used for testing)
- remove `six` as a package dependency
- add `refnx.util.refplot` for quick plotting of reflectometry datasets
- fixed various deprecation warnings
- added the ability to mask (hide) points in a `refnx.dataset.Data1D` dataset

0.1.2
-----
- added save/load model buttons in the interactive reflectometry modeller.
- removed `from __future__ import ...` statements as refnx is now solely Py3
- added `cython: language_level=3` statements to cython code
- marked cython extensions as c++ language
- smarter (faster) cataloging of NeXUS files
- removed pandas as a strict dependency, as it's only required for reduction,
  not analysis
- improved documentation of the ManualBeamFinder
- adding a pyqt based GUI (alpha state)
- improved __repr__ of many classes
- Start the GUI via a 'refnx' console command, via a setup.py entry_point.

0.1.3
-----
- GUI machinery can now use Components other than Slab, such as LipidLeaflet
  (already added). New Components may require extra shim code to be written for
  them. Specifically how they're to be displayed, and a default way of
  initialising the Component (which may require a dialogue).
- The 'Link equivalent parameters' action has been added, enabling equivalent
  parameters on other datasets to be linked. This greatly aids setup of multiple
  contrast datasets. All the datasets to be linked must have the same type of
  structure.
- The initialisation of a LipidLeaflet is made much easier by using a library
  of lipid head/volumes and scattering lengths for popular lipids which are
  presented to the user in an initialisation dialogue.
- The refnx paper is accepted and the article and manuscript file are
  included in the repository.
- The pyqt GUI to refnx can be made into standalone executables for Windows,
  macOS.
- Fixed a bug that meant most reflectivity calculations were single-threaded
  instead of multi-threaded.
- Added MixedReflectModel to the pyqt GUI, allowing one to model 'patchy'
  systems, i.e. incoherent averaging of reflectivities.
- BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: the slabs properties of `Component` and
  `Structure` have now been changed to methods, taking the optional `structure`
  kwd parameter. The reason for this is so each `Component` knows what kind of
  `Structure` it is in.
