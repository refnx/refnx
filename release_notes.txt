Parallelisation
---------------
The reflectivity calculation in the refnx.analysis._creflect module can be
achieved with either openmp or pthreads. If pthreads is available then the
module will use that by default.
To enable openmp usage then set the following flags during the build phase:

*NIX:
CFLAGS=-fopenmp
LDFLAGS=-lgomp

On OSX you might wish to statically link because libgomp is not generally
available with clang.
LDFLAGS="-lgomp -static"

On Windows the flags might be:
CFLAGS="/openmp"

Note: it doesn't make sense to use pthreads AND openmp, it's no quicker. So
these instructions only really apply to those platforms which don't have
pthreads.
