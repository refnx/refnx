/*
    AbelesCalc_ImagAll uses the Abeles matrix method to calculate specular
    reflectivity.
    The system is assumed to consist of a series of uniformly dense layers
    (slabs). The radiation is incident through the fronting medium, leaving
    through the backing medium.

    Parameters
    ----------

    numcoefs - the number of parameters held in the coefP array. This should be
    4 * N + 8 values long, were N is the number of layers.

    coefP - an array holding the parameters.  See below for a more detailed
    description

    npoints - the number of points in the yP and xP arrays

    yP - this user supplied array is filled by the reflect function.  It must be
    npoints long

    xP - array containing the Q (momentum transfer) points. It has units Å**-1.
    The array is npoints long

    Detailed description of the entries in coefP
    --------------------------------------------
    coefP[0] - the number of layers. Should be an integer.
               4 * (int) coefP[0] + 8 == numcoefs

    coefP[1] - scale factor.  The calculated reflectivity is multiplied by this
    value. i.e. yP = scale * ref + background

    coefP[2] - fronting SLD, real part. (10**-6 Å**-2)

    coefP[3] - fronting SLD, imaginary part. (10**-6 Å**-2)

    coefP[4] - backing SLD, real part. (10**-6 Å**-2)

    coefP[5] - backing SLD, imaginary part. (10**-6 Å**-2)

    coefP[6] - background.  A constant value added to all the reflectivity
    points.

    coefP[7] - roughness between backing medium and bottom most layer (Å). If
    there are no layers, the roughness between the fronting and backing media.

    coefP[4 * M + 8] - thickness of layer M, with M = 0, ... N - 1. (Å)

    coefP[4 * M + 9] - SLD of layer M, real part (10**-6 Å**-2)

    coefP[4 * M + 10] - SLD of layer M, imaginary part (10**-6 Å**-2)

    coefP[4 * M + 11] - roughness between layer M - 1 / M (Å)
