  abstract  = {In this work{,} we present the first example of the self-assembly of phospholipid monolayers at the interface between air and an ionic solvent. Deep eutectic solvents are a novel class of environmentally friendly{,} non-aqueous{,} room temperature liquids with tunable properties{,} that have wide-ranging potential applications and are capable of promoting the self-assembly of surfactant molecules. We use a chemically-consistent Bayesian modelling of X-ray and neutron reflectometry measurements to show that these monolayers broadly behave as they do on water. This method allows for the monolayer structure to be determined{,} alongside the molecular volumes of the individual monolayer components{,} without the need for water-specific constraints to be introduced. Furthermore{,} using this method we are able to better understand the correlations present between parameters in the analytical model. This example of a non-aqueous phospholipid monolayer has important implications for the potential uses of these solvents and for our understanding of how biomolecules behave in the absence of water.},

  abstract = {refnx is a model-based neutron and X-ray reflectometry data analysis package written in Python. It is cross platform and has been tested on Linux, macOS and Windows. Its graphical user interface is browser based, through a Jupyter notebook. Model construction is modular, being composed from a series of components that each describe a subset of the interface, parameterized in terms of physically relevant parameters (volume fraction of a polymer, lipid area per molecule etc.). The model and data are used to create an objective, which is used to calculate the residuals, log-likelihood and log-prior probabilities of the system. Objectives are combined to perform co-refinement of multiple data sets and mixed-area models. Prior knowledge of parameter values is encoded as probability distribution functions or bounds on all parameters in the system. Additional prior probability terms can be defined for sets of components, over and above those available from the parameters alone. Algebraic parameter constraints are available. The softwares offers a choice of fitting approaches, including least-squares (global and gradient-based optimizers) and a Bayesian approach using a Markov-chain Monte Carlo algorithm to investigate the posterior distribution of the model parameters. The Bayesian approach is useful for examining parameter covariances, model selection and variability in the resulting scattering length density profiles. The package is designed to facilitate reproducible research; its use in Jupyter notebooks, and subsequent distribution of those notebooks as supporting information, permits straightforward reproduction of analyses.},

  abstract = {The existence of magnetic dipolar nanoparticle chains at zero field has been predicted theoretically for decades, but these structures are rarely observed  experimentally. A prerequisite is a permanent magnetic moment on the particles forming the chain. Here we report on the observation of magnetic dipolar chains of spherical iron oxide nanoparticles with a diameter of 12.8 nm. The nanoparticles are embedded in an ultrathin polymer film. Due to the high viscosity of the polymer matrix, the dominating aggregation mechanism is driven by dipolar interactions. Smaller iron oxide nanoparticles (8 nm) show no permanent magnetic moment and do not form chains but compact aggregates. Mixed monolayers of iron oxide nanoparticles and polymer at the air−water interface are characterized by Langmuir isotherms and in situ X-ray reflectometry (XRR). The combination of the particles with a polymer leads to a stable polymer nanocomposite film at the air−water interface. XRR experiments show that nanoparticles are immersed in a thin polymer matrix of 2 nm. Using atomic force microscopy (AFM) on Langmuir−Blodgett films, we measure the lateral distribution of particles in the film. An analysis  of single structures within transferred films results in fractal dimensions that are in excellent agreement with 2D simulations.},

	abstract = {Neutron and x-ray reflectometry are powerful techniques facilitating the study of the structure of interfacial materials. The analysis of these techniques is ill-posed in nature requiring the application of model-dependent methods. This can lead to the over- and under- analysis of experimental data when too many or too few parameters are allowed to vary in the model. In this work, we outline a robust and generic framework for the determination of the set of free parameters that are capable of maximising the information density of the model. This framework involves the determination of the Bayesian evidence for each permutation of free parameters; and is applied to a simple phospholipid monolayer. We believe this framework should become an important component in reflectometry data analysis and hope others more regularly consider the relative evidence for their analytical models.}

abstract = {Neutron reflectometry is the foremost technique for {\it in situ} determination of the volume fraction profiles of polymer brushes at planar interfaces. However, the subtle features in the reflectometry data produced by these diffuse interfaces challenge data interpretation. Historically, data analyses have used least-squares approaches that do not adequately quantify the uncertainty of the modeled profile and ignore the possibility of other structures that also match the collected data (multimodality). Here, a Bayesian statistical approach is used that permits the structural uncertainty and multimodality to be quantified for polymer brush systems. A free-form model is used to describe the volume fraction profile, minimizing assumptions regarding brush structure, while only allowing physically reasonable profiles to be produced. The model allows the total volume of polymer and the profile monotonicity to be constrained. The rigor of the approach is demonstrated via a round-trip analysis of a simulated system, before it is applied to real data examining the well characterized collapse of a thermoresponsive brush. It is shown that, while failure to constrain the interfacial volume and consider multimodality may result in erroneous structures being derived, carefully constraining the model allows for robust determination of polymer brush compositional profiles. This work highlights that an appropriate combination of flexibility and constraint must be used with polymer brush systems to ensure the veracity of the analysis. The code used in this analysis is provided, enabling the reproduction of the results and the application of the method to similar problems.},
