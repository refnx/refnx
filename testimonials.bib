  abstract  = {In this work{,} we present the first example of the self-assembly of phospholipid monolayers at the interface between air and an ionic solvent. Deep eutectic solvents are a novel class of environmentally friendly{,} non-aqueous{,} room temperature liquids with tunable properties{,} that have wide-ranging potential applications and are capable of promoting the self-assembly of surfactant molecules. We use a chemically-consistent Bayesian modelling of X-ray and neutron reflectometry measurements to show that these monolayers broadly behave as they do on water. This method allows for the monolayer structure to be determined{,} alongside the molecular volumes of the individual monolayer components{,} without the need for water-specific constraints to be introduced. Furthermore{,} using this method we are able to better understand the correlations present between parameters in the analytical model. This example of a non-aqueous phospholipid monolayer has important implications for the potential uses of these solvents and for our understanding of how biomolecules behave in the absence of water.},

  abstract = {refnx is a model-based neutron and X-ray reflectometry data analysis package written in Python. It is cross platform and has been tested on Linux, macOS and Windows. Its graphical user interface is browser based, through a Jupyter notebook. Model construction is modular, being composed from a series of components that each describe a subset of the interface, parameterized in terms of physically relevant parameters (volume fraction of a polymer, lipid area per molecule etc.). The model and data are used to create an objective, which is used to calculate the residuals, log-likelihood and log-prior probabilities of the system. Objectives are combined to perform co-refinement of multiple data sets and mixed-area models. Prior knowledge of parameter values is encoded as probability distribution functions or bounds on all parameters in the system. Additional prior probability terms can be defined for sets of components, over and above those available from the parameters alone. Algebraic parameter constraints are available. The softwares offers a choice of fitting approaches, including least-squares (global and gradient-based optimizers) and a Bayesian approach using a Markov-chain Monte Carlo algorithm to investigate the posterior distribution of the model parameters. The Bayesian approach is useful for examining parameter covariances, model selection and variability in the resulting scattering length density profiles. The package is designed to facilitate reproducible research; its use in Jupyter notebooks, and subsequent distribution of those notebooks as supporting information, permits straightforward reproduction of analyses.},

  abstract = {The existence of magnetic dipolar nanoparticle chains at zero field has been predicted theoretically for decades, but these structures are rarely observed  experimentally. A prerequisite is a permanent magnetic moment on the particles forming the chain. Here we report on the observation of magnetic dipolar chains of spherical iron oxide nanoparticles with a diameter of 12.8 nm. The nanoparticles are embedded in an ultrathin polymer film. Due to the high viscosity of the polymer matrix, the dominating aggregation mechanism is driven by dipolar interactions. Smaller iron oxide nanoparticles (8 nm) show no permanent magnetic moment and do not form chains but compact aggregates. Mixed monolayers of iron oxide nanoparticles and polymer at the air−water interface are characterized by Langmuir isotherms and in situ X-ray reflectometry (XRR). The combination of the particles with a polymer leads to a stable polymer nanocomposite film at the air−water interface. XRR experiments show that nanoparticles are immersed in a thin polymer matrix of 2 nm. Using atomic force microscopy (AFM) on Langmuir−Blodgett films, we measure the lateral distribution of particles in the film. An analysis  of single structures within transferred films results in fractal dimensions that are in excellent agreement with 2D simulations.},

The analysis of these techniques is ill-posed in nature requiring the application of model-dependent methods. This can lead to the over- and under- analysis of experimental data when too many or too few parameters are allowed to vary in the model. In this work, we outline a robust and generic framework for the determination of the set of free parameters that are capable of maximising the information density of the model. This framework involves the determination of the Bayesian evidence for each permutation of free parameters; and is applied to a simple phospholipid monolayer. We believe this framework should become an important component in reflectometry data analysis and hope others more regularly consider the relative evidence for their analytical models.},

  abstract = {Neutron reflectometry is the foremost technique for {\it in situ} determination of the volume fraction profiles of polymer brushes at planar interfaces. However, the subtle features in the reflectometry data produced by these diffuse interfaces challenge data interpretation. Historically, data analyses have used least-squares approaches that do not adequately quantify the uncertainty of the modeled profile and ignore the possibility of other structures that also match the collected data (multimodality). Here, a Bayesian statistical approach is used that permits the structural uncertainty and multimodality to be quantified for polymer brush systems. A free-form model is used to describe the volume fraction profile, minimizing assumptions regarding brush structure, while only allowing physically reasonable profiles to be produced. The model allows the total volume of polymer and the profile monotonicity to be constrained. The rigor of the approach is demonstrated via a round-trip analysis of a simulated system, before it is applied to real data examining the well characterized collapse of a thermoresponsive brush. It is shown that, while failure to constrain the interfacial volume and consider multimodality may result in erroneous structures being derived, carefully constraining the model allows for robust determination of polymer brush compositional profiles. This work highlights that an appropriate combination of flexibility and constraint must be used with polymer brush systems to ensure the veracity of the analysis. The code used in this analysis is provided, enabling the reproduction of the results and the application of the method to similar problems.},

It was found that the conventional device structure had power conversion efficiencies two and a half times that of the inverted device, 9.0% versus 4.0%. Through a combination of Shockley equivalent circuit fitting, optical modelling, and light intensity dependence photocurrent measurements we identified that the origin of the power losses for the inverted architecture relative to the conventional device structure arose from a larger component of bimolecular recombination. Neutron reflectometry measurements showed that the origin of the larger bimolecular recombination losses for the inverted device was due to the PC71BM phase separating, with a PC71BM rich layer located near the anode reducing the hole extraction efficiency.},

    abstract = {Hypothesis
    Anionic surfactants have been reported to interact with poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAM), suppressing its thermoresponse. Scattering and NMR studies of the anionic sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) system propose that the PNIPAM-surfactant interaction is purely hydrophobic. However, prior phenomenological investigations of a range of surfactant identities (anionic, cationic, nonionic) show that only anionic surfactants affect the thermoresponse and conformation of PNIPAM, implying that the hydrophilic head–group also contributes. Crucially, the phenomenological experiments do not measure the affinity of the tested surfactants to the polymer, only their effect on its behaviour.
    Experiments
    We study the adsorption of six surfactants within a planar PNIPAM brush system, elucidating the polymer conformation, thermoresponse, and surfactant adsorption kinetics using ellipsometry, neutron reflectometry (NR), optical reflectometry and the quartz crystal microbalance technique. NR is used to measure the distribution of surfactants within the brush.
    Findings
    We find that only anionic surfactants modify the structure and thermoresponse of PNIPAM, with the greater affinity of anionic surfactants for PNIPAM (relative to cationic and nonionic surfactants) being the primary reason for this behaviour. These results show that the surfactant head–group has a more critical role in mediating PNIPAM-surfactant interaction than previously reported. Taking inspiration from prior molecular dynamics work on the PEO-surfactant system, we propose an interaction mechanism for PNIPAM and SDS that reconciles evidence for hydrophobic interaction with the observed head–group-dependent affinity.},

Here, we investigate the condensation of humid air at low subcooling condition (11 °C), similar to conditions for natural dew capture, and explore how water contact angle and contact angle hysteresis affect the rates of water capture. We compare water collection on three families of surfaces: (i) hydrophilic (polyethylene oxide, MPEO) and hydrophobic (polydimethylsiloxane, PDMS) molecularly thin coatings grafted on smooth silicon wafers, which produce slippery covalently attached liquid surfaces (SCALSs), with low contact angle hysteresis (CAH = 6°); (ii) the same coatings grafted on rougher glass, with high CAH (20°–25°); (iii) hydrophilic polymer surfaces [poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone), PNVP] with high CAH (30°). Upon exposure to water, the MPEO SCALS swell, which likely further increases their droplet shedding ability. MPEO and PDMS coatings collect similar volume of water (around 5 l m−2 day−1), both when they are SCALS and non-slippery. Both MPEO and PDMS layers collect about 20\\% more water than PNVP surfaces. We present a basic model showing that, under low heat flux conditions, on all MPEO and PDMS layers, the droplets are so small (600–2000 µm) that there is no/low heat conduction resistance across the droplets, irrespective of the exact value of contact angle and CAH. As the time to first droplet departure is much faster on MPEO SCALS (28 min) than on PDMS SCALS (90 min), slippery hydrophilic surfaces are preferable in dew collection applications where the collection time frame is limited.}",

abstract = {Abstract The effect of electron-beam patterning on the water uptake and ionic conductivity of Nafion films using a combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, quartz crystal microbalance studies, neutron reflectometry, and impedance spectroscopy is reported. The aim is to further characterize the nanoscale patterned Nafion structures recently used as a key element in novel ion-to-electron transducers by Gluschke et al. To enable this, the electron beam patterning process is developed for large areas, achieving patterning speeds approaching 1 cm2 h−1, and patterned areas as large as 7 cm2 for the neutron reflectometry studies. It is ultimately shown that electron-beam patterning affects both the water uptake and the ionic conductivity, depending on film thickness. Type-II adsorption isotherm behavior is seen for all films. For thick films (≈230 nm), a strong reduction in water uptake with electron-beam patterning is found. In contrast, for thin films (≈30 nm), electron-beam patterning enhances water uptake. Notably, for either thickness, the reduction in ionic conductivity arising from electron-beam patterning is kept to less than an order of magnitude. Mechanisms are proposed for the observed behavior based on the known complex morphology of Nafion films to motivate future studies of electron-beam processed Nafion.}

abstract = {Slippery covalently-attached liquid surfaces (SCALS) with low contact angle hysteresis (CAH, <5◦) and nanoscale thickness display impressive anti-adhesive properties, similar to lubricant-infused surfaces. Their efficacy is generally attributed to the liquid-like mobility of the constituent tethered chains. However, the precise physico-chemical properties that facilitate this mobility are unknown, hindering rational design. This work quantifies the chain length, grafting density, and microviscosity of a range of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) SCALS, elucidating the nanostructure responsible for their properties. Three prominent methods are used to produce SCALS, with characterization carried out via single-molecule force measurements, neutron reflectometry, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. CO2 snow-jet cleaning was also shown to reduce the CAH of SCALS via a modification of their grafting density. SCALS behavior can be predicted by reduced grafting density, Σ, with the lowest water CAH achieved at Σ ≈ 2. This study provides the first direct examination of SCALS grafting density, chain length, and microviscosity and supports the hypothesis that SCALS properties stem from a balance of layer uniformity and mobility.}

    abstract = {Hypersaline environments are ubiquitous in nature and are found in myriad technological processes. Recent empirical studies have revealed a significant discrepancy between the predicted and observed screening lengths at high salt concentrations, a phenomenon referred to as underscreening. Herein we investigate underscreening using a cationic polyelectrolyte brush as an exemplar. Poly(2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl)trimethylammonium (PMETAC) brushes were synthesised and their internal structural changes and swelling response monitored with neutron reflectometry and spectroscopic ellipsometry. Both techniques revealed a monotonic brush collapse as the concentration of symmetric monovalent electrolyte increased. However, a non-monotonic change in brush thickness was observed in all multivalent electrolytes at higher electrolyte concentrations, known as re-entrant swelling; indicative of underscreening. For all electrolytes, numerical self-consistent field theory predictions align with experimental studies in the low salt concentration (Debye–Hu ̈ckel) region. Analysis suggests that the classical theory of electrolytes is insufficient to describe the screening lengths observed at high salt concentrations and that the re-entrant polyelectrolyte brush swelling in the high salt concentration region is consistent with regular underscreening.}

    abstract = {Hypothesis
    Understanding the complex interactions between polymers and surfactants is required to optimise commercially relevant systems such as paint, toothpaste and detergent. Neutral polymers complex with surfactants, forming ‘pearl necklace’ structures that are often conceptualised as pseudo-polyelectrolytes. Here we pose two questions to test the limits of this analogy: Firstly, in the presence of salt, do these polymer-surfactant systems behave like polyelectrolytes? Secondly, do polymer-surfactant complexes resist geometric confinement like polyelectrolytes?
    Experiments
    We test the limits of the pseudo-polyelectrolyte analogy through studying a poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) brush in the presence of sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS). Brushes are ideal for interrogating pseudo-polyelectrolytes, as neutral and polyelectrolyte brushes exhibit distinct and well understood behaviours. Spectroscopic ellipsometry, quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D), and neutron reflectometry (NR) were used to monitor the behaviour and structure of the PNIPAM-SDS system as a function of NaCl concentration. The ability of the PNIPAM-SDS complex to resist geometric confinement was probed with NR.
    Findings
    At a fixed SDS concentration below the zero-salt CMC, increasing NaCl concentration Image 1 promoted brush swelling due to an increase in osmotic pressure, not dissimilar to a weak polyelectrolyte. At these salt concentrations, the swelling of the brush could be described by a single parameter: the effective CMC. However, at high NaCl concentrations (e.g., Image 2) no brush collapse was observed at all (non-zero) concentrations of SDS studied, contrary to what is seen for many polyelectrolytes. Study of the polymer-surfactant system under confinement revealed that the physical volume of surfactant dominates the structure of the strongly confined system, which further differentiates it from the polyelectrolyte case.}

    abstract = {Hypothesis
    Graphene oxide-based nanotechnology has aroused a great interest due to its applications in the biomedical and optoelectronic fields. The wide use of these materials makes it necessary to study its potential toxicity associated with the inhalation of Graphene Oxide (GO) nanoparticles and its interaction with the lung surfactant. Langmuir monolayers have proven to be an excellent tool for studying the properties of the lung surfactant and the effect of intercalation of nanoparticles on its structure and properties. Therefore, to know the origin of the phospholipids/GO interaction and the structure of the lipid layer with GO, in this work we study the effect of the insertion of GO sheets on a Langmuir film of 1,2-Dipalmitoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine (DPPC).
    Experiments
    Surface pressure-area isotherms, Neutron (NR) and X-ray Reflectivity (XRR) and Grazing Incidence X-ray Diffraction (GIXD) measurements of hydrogenated and deuterated DPPC monolayers with and without GO have been carried out.
    Findings
    The results outline a strong interaction between the GO and the zwitterionic form of DPPC and prove that GO is in three regions of the DPPC monolayer, the aliphatic chains of DPPC, the head groups and water in the subphase. Comparison between results obtained with hydrogenated and deuterated DPPC allows concluding that both, electrostatic attractions, and dispersion forces are responsible of the interaction GO/DPPC. Results also demonstrated that the insertion of GO into the DPPC aliphatic chains does not induce significant changes on unit cell of DPPC.}

    abstract = { Pertinent to cryopreservation as well as energy storage and batteries, nonaqueous electrolytes and their mixtures with water were investigated. In particular, specific ion-induced effects on the modulation of a poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) brush were investigated in various dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)–water solvent mixtures. Spectroscopic ellipsometry and neutron reflectometry were employed to probe changes in brush swelling and structure, respectively. In water-rich solvents (i.e., pure water and 6 mol \% DMSO), PNIPAM undergoes a swollen to collapsed thermotransition with increasing temperature, whereby a forward Hofmeister series was noted; K+ and Li+ electrolytes composed of SCN– and I– salted-in (stabilized) PNIPAM chains, and electrolytes of Cl– and Br– salted-out (destabilized) the polymer. The cation was seen to play a lesser role than that of the anion, merely modulating the magnitude of the anion effect. In 70 mol \% DMSO, a collapsed to swollen thermotransition was noted for PNIPAM. Here, concentration-dependent specific ion effects were observed; a forward series was observed in 0.2 mol \% electrolytes, whereas increasing the electrolyte concentration to 0.9 mol \% led to a series reversal. While no thermotransition was observed in pure DMSO, a solvent-induced specific ion series reversal was noted; SCN– destabilized the brush and Cl– stabilized the brush. Both series reversals are attributed to the delicate balance of interactions between the solvent, solute (ion), and substrate (brush). Namely, the stability of the solvent clusters was hypothesized to drive polymer solvation. }
